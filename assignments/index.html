            <h3> About Me</h3>
            <p> Hi! My name is Morann Ronne and I am currently a senior at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. I am majoring in Advertising and Public Relations with a minor in Communications. I am originally from a small town in Nebraska, and I want to live here my whole life because I love it so much!!</p>

            <h3>Classes this Semester</h3>
            <p> This semester I am currently taking 18 credit hours. I am taking Mass Media Law, Social Justice and Human Rights, Interactive Media Design, An online Arabic class, and an experience lab called Heartland Pulse. </p>

            <h3>Outside of Class</h3>
            <p>Outside of class I really enjoy shopping, reading, and doing activites with my friends and family. I am the type of person who is always down to go do anything, I love to have fun. I love spending time outside, espically in the summer at the lake.</p>

            <h3>After Graduation</h3>
            <p>After graduation, I hope to have a career in event planning. I completed an internship at my local country club for event and marketing coordinating and that made me realize that is exactly what I want to do in life. Like I said, I love going out and doing anything, so I want to be able to help other people plan their perfect events!!</p>
